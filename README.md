# WILD-LIFE-1
Wildlife includes all non-domesticated animals, plants, and organisms in natural habitats. It plays a crucial role in maintaining ecological balance through pollination, seed dispersal, and pest control. Conservation efforts are vital to protect biodiversity from threats like habitat destruction, poaching, and climate change.
